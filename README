These two files are the Google AppEngine implementation of the Kinds of a Thing / Things of a Kind 
database project.  Just drop these two files into the root directory for your AppEngine project,
deploy the project, and you should be up and running.  Hopefully.

To test, using CURL, try the following:

>curl 'http://your-implementation-name.appspot.com/?k1=this&k2=that'

Which should return '[]', the JSON for an empty array.
